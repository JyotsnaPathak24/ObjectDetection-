# ObjectDetection-
Object detection using machine learning algorithms with the help of OpenCV. It conjointly shows the flexibleness of a pursuit system to a moving camera, ideal for automotive safety applications. the item pursuit algorithmic program is termed centre of mass pursuit because it depends on the geometsse of mass huntsman has already seen before) and (2) new object centroids between ensuant frames in an exceedingly video.
