# ObjectDetection-
This paper covers topics starting from how computing and machine learning algorithms facilitate object detection to how OpenCV is such a great tool for beginners who want to be told however real time object detection and pursuit is done. It conjointly shows the flexibleness of a pursuit system to a moving camera, ideal for automotive safety applications. the item pursuit algorithmic program is termed centre of mass pursuit because it depends on the geometrician distance between (1) existing object centroids (i.e., objects the centre of mass huntsman has already seen before) and (2) new object centroids between ensuant frames in an exceedingly video.
